    <p>This simple, quick and easy recipe for homemade fresh tomato soup is perfect to make when 
        <br>tomatoes are ripe in gardens and farmers' markets for a delicious summertime treat. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 slice onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, large slice of onion, garlic cloves, 
            <br>and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of 
            <br>the flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, 
            <br>or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill..</li>
        <li>In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, 
            <br>cooking until the roux is a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so 
            <br>that no lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.</li>
    </ol>
